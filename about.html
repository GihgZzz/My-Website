        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Nestled in the western region of Georgia, Khibula is one of the more prominent villages, larger than most others in the country. The village is graced by two beautiful rivers: Khobis Tskali, a majestic and expansive river, and Tsentskari. These rivers add to the natural beauty of the area and have become central to the local landscape.<br>
          Khibula is not only known for its stunning rivers but also for its historical significance. In the mountains surrounding the village, you can find the ruins of an ancient castle known as Jikha. It is believed that this castle was built in a mountainous location for strategic reasonsâ€”providing safety during times of enemy invasions.<br>
          The village holds a dark chapter in Georgia's modern history. It is the place where Georgia's first president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, tragically lost his life. While some believe it was a suicide, evidence points to the possibility of foul play. Two bullet holes found in the wall of the house where he died challenge the theory of suicide. Today, this house has been transformed into a museum, allowing visitors to learn more about Gamsakhurdia's life and the mystery surrounding his death.<br>
          In addition to its historical significance, Khibula is also known for its intellectual legacy. The village has produced some extraordinary minds, including Levan Ghvinjilia, a renowned figure from Khibula who is celebrated for his contributions to Georgian society.<br>
          Among the other beautiful sights in the village, there's a picturesque church located near the museum, adding to the serenity and spiritual atmosphere of the area. Khibula is a village that, despite its size, continues to stand as a beacon of beauty, history, and intellect in Georgia.<br>
